Tens of thousands of men, women and children are diagnosed each year with facial paralysis caused by conditions such as Bell’s Palsy, Synkinesis, Ramsay Hunt, Lyme Disease, Acoustic Neuroma, Congenital Facial Palsy, Parotid Tumor, and many other causes, as well as TMD / TMJ disorders (Temporomandibular disorder).  These conditions get little to no acknowledgement and millions of people are suffering from pain along with emotional distress with these conditions.

We at the Foundation for Facial Recovery want these individuals to know they are not alone and there is hope and help!

Last year our first annual FACE the Challenge event raised over $17,532 that will go towards research projects to improve facial palsy and TMJ disorder.

We're a design-centric organization—the design of the site falls short, as it feels flat, somewhat boring, and not very lively. Our members have expressed some displeasure with the site's design.

Moreover, this February, we launched anew blog/microsite with our website, which is to be the ""mouthpeice"" for the New Urbanism movement. More than the main website, this microsite (cnu.org/publicsquare) isn't very polished. The functionality, the search, and categorizing are still clumsy.

However, both projects went over budget and we're not happy with the web development we hired.

I am the Chief of Staff of Young Progressives Demanding Action a student led issue based organization fighting for youth power on college and high school campuses throughout the US. 



We are revisiting our vision statement and trying to develop a five year plan monetarily and as it relates to our goals. We created a vision mapping document a couple of months ago, but we would like to revisit it. Also, I would like to create a structure in place to be iterative and reflexive in our vision mapping as an organization. We struggle because we constantly feel as though we need to be taking care of the present and organizing that we do not oft get the opportunity to reflect and be prospective in the work we're doing. Any help would be appreciated.

Ashoka has implemented the FinancialForce HCM (Human Capital Management) app on its Salesforce platform.  There are a dozen modules - half of which are configured for use by staff worldwide and half of which need to be customized to each country that Ashoka operates in.  The modules for worldwide use have been operational for two years and have received positive traction within the organization (see links below).  The project to customize and implement the modules for each country has been slow to start.  Initially, it was determined to hire a dedicated resource to handle this work; it's been 15 months without luck.

I am the new interim executive director (previously development director) at a small nonprofit that has been operating for 6 years. In the past 3 years we have had massive growth, and last year hired a full staff (beyond an ED and programming officer) for the first time to meet the needs of that growth. We are considering laying off our director of operations due to concerns about meeting our budget, and because we have identified that her duties could be most easily covered by the rest of the staff. We are concerned that this employee will sue, and also about the effect on morale among other staff. I would like to get some guidance on the legal protection provided by a layoff of this nature, and whether or not there might be better ways to do this. The current idea is to hold a board vote to reduce payroll given funding concerns, and then meet with the employee to break the news. We are looking to achieve this within a short time frame, roughly 30 days. The organization has a $757,000 budget this year and 6 core staff, with 7 part time staff.

We are a non-profit afterschool/ Summer Camp offering STEAM education in the SF Bay Area. Our approach is based on a Russian mathematics model.  We introduce and explore math concepts and problem-solving techniques. Theoretical instructions are combined with practical exercises that employ chess, brain teasers, and logical puzzles to demonstrate serious mathematical concepts.

This is a great chance to create a website for the STEAM education marketplace. This will also give you a chance to learn about the afterschool marketplace. Also, there will be a high growth in the afterschool marketplace when millennials begin having children.
